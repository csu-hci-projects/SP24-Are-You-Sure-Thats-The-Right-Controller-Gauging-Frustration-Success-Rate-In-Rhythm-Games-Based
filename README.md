# SP24-Are-You-Sure-Thats-The-Right-Controller-Gauging-Frustration-Success-Rate-In-Rhythm-Games-Based

## Project Description
Have you ever thought that you had the right controller for the type of game you were playing? Does the controller have tilt controls that can assist or hinder your experience and your performance for the game? What about the general size of the controller, does it feel too small or too big in your hands? Controller types and the controller’s input can affect how a player can approach a game. Among some common video game genres, controller type and input can affect how a rhythm game can take input based on the player and their controller. A button could be a little too small for the player’s thumb and they accidentally miss pressing the button, a trigger button requires too much pressure to be taken in as an input for the player, or perhaps a controller scheme is just right for a player to succeed. Our project will focus on different dynamics between controller input, frustration, and success rates within a project-made rhythm game.
